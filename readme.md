## Data migrator (MongoDB)

Migrate your data from old database to a new one. This is a project that i made when i was bored, i'm sure there must be a bug. You can tell me if you want, if you don't, then don't.

### Installation:
1. ok so you must have nodejs and npm, ofc
2. git clone this repo and cd to this project's path
3. run `npm i`
4. Add your mongodb uri in `config.json`
5. run `node .`

### If working, it must be like this
